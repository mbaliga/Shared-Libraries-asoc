/**
 * Shake-to-refresh.
 *
 * Replaces the retired pull-to-backup gesture (owner direction, 2026-08-05): the pull-down space
 * at the top of a room belongs to [SpatialShell]'s top-room reveal, not to refresh — so refresh
 * moves off the touch plane entirely and onto the device itself. A deliberate shake is hard to do
 * by accident, needs no on-screen affordance or copy, and doesn't compete with any scroll gesture,
 * which is exactly why it suits an action whose only job is "look again".
 *
 * It lives in this module rather than in any one app for the same reason the rooms do: the shell
 * owns the four screen edges, so every app that adopts the shell inherits the same problem — its
 * refresh gesture has been evicted — and they should all solve it the same way.
 *
 * Detection: gravity-normalized acceleration must exceed [SHAKE_THRESHOLD_G] on
 * [SHAKES_REQUIRED] distinct peaks inside [SHAKE_WINDOW_MS] — one bump against a table is one
 * peak and does nothing; an actual shake is a back-and-forth train of them. After firing, a
 * [COOLDOWN_MS] refractory period stops one enthusiastic shake from triggering twice.
 *
 * The listener is registered only while the owning composition is RESUMED — backgrounded, the
 * sensor is off and costs nothing. A device with no accelerometer simply never fires; there is
 * nothing to report and nothing to fall back to.
 *
 * @param onShake fired on the main thread when a shake completes. Read through
 *   [rememberUpdatedState], so a caller may pass a fresh lambda every recomposition without
 *   tearing down and re-registering the sensor.
